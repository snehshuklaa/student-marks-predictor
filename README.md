# student-marks-predictor
For the first time using python i have made a project. Here we predicted the marks of students according to their study hours. I made this project under leanin mentorship program. Ilook forward to make more projects.
Made on google colab. This a Machine Leaning Project on students marks predictor. We calculate the marks of the students on the basis of the number of hours they spend studying. I have used python libraries Numpy , Pandas and Matplotlib for the following code. In the code you will find use of some basic functions like head() , tail() , show(), mean() and many more just to provide a basic understanding of how the program works and how we obtain our final results. A scatter plot in the end of the program is shown for graphical point of view and to establish relation between the variables.
